Description: A household survey on water costs and coping strategies as well as a water point survey were conducted in two low-income communities in metropolitan Accra. These are Korle Gonno, a larger, well-planned coastal area with over 35 household water vendors, and Abuja, a small, densely packed, extralegal settlement with 15 water vendor and bathhouse businesses.
